# Description:
This is to make the process of preregistration quicker. The students have to go through a tedious process of finding the faculty assigned to various sections by going through an excel file. I tried to make it a bit easier. 
# How it works: 
In the beginning of the semester, we are given an excel file which specifies which faculty is assigned to specific sections of different courses. I have processed this excel file with pandas library in python so that the faculty name can be easily found out by just inputting the section and course code during preregistration. 

This is something I always wanted. So I made one for myself.
